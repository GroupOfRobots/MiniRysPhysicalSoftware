## OpenCV

Basically, there was no openCV library on the RPI. You had to install it, for example, with the command `sudo apt install -y python3-opencv`.  It could also be done via `pip`. ROS 2 did not include the `cv_bridge` library. It can be installed by  following the instructions at `https://index.ros.org/p/cv_bridge/`. However the needed library is also linked to this repository by `git submodule`
